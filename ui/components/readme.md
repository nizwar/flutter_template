# Components
Components are reusable widgets designed to prevent repetitive code and simplify the development process. They can be easily called and utilized anywhere they are needed, promoting consistency and maintainability across the project.

Components are often used to display the user interface representation of models, streamlining the process of creating consistent and reusable UI elements tied to your data structures.
